# Is Reality Still Socially Constructed?

Accompanying materials for manuscript "Is Reality Still Socially Constructed?" published 2026 in *The American Sociologist* (DOI link here). Licensing agreements from Constellate and JSTOR prevent sharing complete full-text data, but analysis scripts and secondary datasets are included here as available. 

## Study 1
Raw data for each journal (ASR, AJS, SF) were collected via Constellate, which exports extremely large csv files for metadata, unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams. The first three cleaning scripts cleaned and saved these as RData files. Subsequent analysis conducted in the attached scripts: 
- 20250304 start = cleaning and summary statistics of metadata
- 20250515 start2 = filtering textdata based on clean metadata
- 20250516 analysis = searching for "social* construct" and graphing
- 20250520 analysis = extra analyses, not reported in manuscript

The scr_df.RData file is the exported results after word-search results were bound together.
